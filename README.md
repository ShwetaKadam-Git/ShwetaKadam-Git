# 👋 Hi there, I'm Shweta!

I'm a tech generalist with roots in SAP MII and a passion for building innovative solutions — the kind that bridge data driven solutions with modern AI and great user experiences.

By day, I am pursuing my 🎓 master’s in Germany, diving deep into topics like deep learning for medical imaging (ask me about ACL tears and MRI classification 👨‍⚕️[![ACL-DNet Blog](https://img.shields.io/badge/-📝%20Blog-blue?style=flat-square "ACL-DNet blog post")](https://shwetakadam-git.github.io/ACL-DNet/). By night, I am crafting responsive front ends, playing with new tech stacks, and chasing ideas that keep me up past midnight. Not all of them land; but hey, at least I sleep knowing I gave them a shot.

I'm curious about 🧠 applied deep learning and 💡 turning complex problems into modern, usable systems.

Currently working on improving my skills in the areas - full stack development, little bit of data analytics, AI. And I hope to deepen my skillsets using different avenues along the way.
